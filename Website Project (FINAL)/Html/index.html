                seating
                and mingling, such as the living room, spacious kitchen, or even a cozy den. The chosen space should

                a relaxed setting that encourages conversation and enjoyment.</p>

          <p>Snakes and Ladders is a classic board game that is simple to play and enjoyed by people of all ages. It involves a game of luck with players climbing ladders and sliding down snakes as they move their tokens towards the finish.</p>

          <br>
          <b>How to Play:</b>
          Setup: Each player places their token on the starting square (usually marked as 1).
          Rolling the Dice: Players take turns rolling a single die and move their token forward the number of squares indicated by the die.
          Ladders: If a player lands on a square with the base of a ladder, they climb to the square at the top of the ladder.
         Snakes: If a player lands on a square with the head of a snake, they slide down to the square at the snake's tail.
         Winning: The first player to reach the final square (usually marked as 100) exactly wins the game. If a roll would take the player past the final square, their token remains in place, and their turn ends.

          <br>
          <b>Location to Play:</b> Indoor Large Hall and Room.
          <br>

          <p>In Hide and Seek, players run and hide before another player tries to find them.
          <br>
          <b>How to Play:</b>
          In Hide and Seek, players run and hide before another player tries to find them. It’s perfect for a 
          rainy afternoon indoors, or a sunny day in a big yard or a park. The rules are simple, but there are 
          countless variations to try with your friends. We’ll show you how to play a standard game of Hide and Go 
          Seek, then show you some ways to mix up the rules for maximum fun.
            <br>
            <b>Location to Play:</b> Outdoor (Park, Garden and wide open space).
            <br>
            <b>Things Needed:</b>Gather at least 2 players and pick someone to be the seeker. The rest of the players are the hiders.
            The seeker counts up to 100 while the other players hide. Then, the seeker yells, “Ready or not, here I come!” and starts to search for the hiders.
            Once the seeker finds all the hiders (or gives up), the round is over. The first person who was found is the seeker in the next round. 
            <br>
            <b>Players::</b> 2+ players (more fun with larger groups).

          <h1 class="kg">Capture the Flag</h1>
          <p>A classic outdoor game where two teams compete to capture the opposing team's flag and return it to their base while defending their own flag.
            <br>
            <b>How to Play:</b>Divide players into two teams.

            Each team hides their flag within their territory.
            
            Players must strategize to capture the enemy flag while avoiding being tagged.
            
            A player tagged in the enemy's territory is sent to a designated "jail" and must be freed by teammates.
            
            The game ends when a team successfully captures the opponent's flag and returns it to their base.
            <br>
            <b>Location to Play:</b>Outdoor, Park, Beach and any open space.
            <br>
            <b>Things Needed:</b>Flags: Two distinct flags, one for each team. Brightly colored or unique designs work best.

            Boundary Markers: Cones, ropes, or natural features like trees to mark the territory boundaries and jail areas.
            <br>
            <b>Players::</b> 5 player per team (total-10)
